                    <p>Topinterns gave me the opportunity to start a career as a web developer,
                         I was offered real work projects with real employees, and I would say before I found this program I was lost and not knowing where to learn 
                         the necessary fundamentals to start working as soon as possible, and Topinterns provided both, I was taught the fundamentals and offered a junior 
                         web developer position at Laimoon, and then was given an opportunity to intern at Souqalmal. The work experience was amazing, I worked with really 
                         amazing people and I have learned so much if I told my self I learned React, html, different css frameworks like tailwind and ant design, typescript 
                         and wordpress, node js in such a short amount of time I would have not believed my self! 
                        I am thankful and grateful for this opportunity and would recommend to to anyone that wants to start a career in web development but doesn‚Äôt know 
                        where to start.</p>

                    <p>Saleem is a great mentor and a great leader. I was Saleem's student when he taught Web Development at Laimoon. 
                        Three times per week he gave me and a group of students, detailed technical lessons regarding full stack development. 
                        His class was full of great knowledge regarding industry best practices. Thanks to Saleem, I was able to have a level in web 
                        development that is valuable to outside companies, 
                        I was able to build a portfolio and I was able to apply what he told me, to learn new technologies.</p>

                    <p>Taking this course made it a lot easier for me to get in to coding and web development world. 
                        The course content, and the instructor Saleem Hadad made it very easy to learn and understand even though I had no previous knowledge of 
                        Computer science and coding. I would highly recommend anyone to take this course be it anyone who is a beginner or Professional in Web Development. 
                        The best part of the course was the live interactive classes to learn, study and get all doubts cleared out. 
                        Another part which made me take up the course is the internship.
                         It helps you get experience in the work field and apply all the knowledge gained in the course.</p>
