                        <p>At the Bootcamp, you will be completing 16 assignments, 3 group projects including a hackathon and a final examination. 
                            All these will be scored, where you have to attain 90% or more to qualify for an interview. 
                            If you do well at the interview, you will be offered a position for the internship.</p>

                        <p>Real work experience is the most important achievement that employers look for in a candidate. 
                            The internship will give you that required experience and will certainly boost your chances of getting a job. 
                            If the company where you are interning has a full time position open and they liked your work, you may stand a 
                            chance of getting hired directly by them. 
                            If they donâ€™t have an open position, they will likely keep your CV on file for a later opening.</p>
